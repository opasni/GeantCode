# GeantCode

This is some of my work, that I did for my master thesis. The thesis was considering an experiment measuring the Axial Form Factor of neutron in a way that was not done before (colliding low-energy electrons with static protons - liquid hydrogen - and measuring the cross-section of the created neutrons). The problem of the experiment is a big electromagnetic background created in the target, that results in an enormous background signal in the detector, when compared to the signal from the neutrons).
The simulations were done using the Geant simulation toolkit. Although Geant contains big amount of libraries and processes, I had to implement the Inverse Beta process, which was necessary for my thesis. 

If you find this usefull, let me know, also if you have some questions regarding the usage of Geant, I will gladly answer, best as I can!

Best regards!
