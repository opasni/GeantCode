# GeantCode

This is some of my work, that I did for my master thesis. The thesis was considering an experiment measuring the Axial Form Facto of neutron in a way that was not done before. The simulations were done using the Geant simulation toolkit. Although Geant contains big amount of libraries and processes, I had to implement the Inverse Beta process, which was necessary for my thesis. 

If you find this usefull, let me know, also if you have some questions regarding the usage of Geant, I will gladly answer, best as I can!

Best regards!
